- DS - Visited set, priority_queue<pair> , unordered_map

- insert the pair of < -1, src> in the pq.
- one by one remove the root element of the pq
- if the root element is already visited, then we will just continue.
- we mark the root visited
- we store the wt of the pair in the ans
- update the mapping
- go to every neighbour of the curr element, and only add those which are non visited and have a better wt proposition.
